# Predict
# I expect the code to output Please input a length: and waits for the user to enter a length
# It will then output The area of a square of side length (length the user entered) is: (result of entered number to the power of 2)

# Run
# My prediction was correct

# Inspect
# It stopped in execution because it is waiting for the input from the user
# For example, I input 10, and it output The area of a square of side length 10.0 is: 100.0, which did match my calculator answer (besides the .0 part which is due to the value being a float)

# Modify
import math
radius = input("Input the circle's radius: ")
radius = float(radius)
area = 0.5*math.pi*math.pow(radius, 2) + 4*math.pow(radius, 2)
print("Area is:", area)
# The reason why radius has to be multiplied by 2 in part of the formula is because you need the diameter/length where radius is only half of that
